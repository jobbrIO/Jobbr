# FileSystem Storage Provider [![Develop build status][artefact-fs-badge-build-develop]][artefact-fs-link-build]

This is a storage provider implementation for the [Jobbr .NET JobServer](http://www.jobbr.io) to store artefacts related from job runs on the filesystem in a folder of your choice. 
The Jobbr main repository can be found on [JobbrIO/jobbr-server](https://github.com/jobbrIO).

## Installation
First of all you'll need a working jobserver by using the usual builder as shown in the demos ([jobbrIO/jobbr-demo](https://github.com/jobbrIO/jobbr-demo)). In addition to that you'll need to install the NuGet Package for this extension.

### NuGet

    Install-Package Jobbr.ArtefactStorage.FileSystem

### Configuration
Since you already have a configured server, the registration of the provider is quite easy. See Example below

```c#
using Jobbr.ArtefactStorage.FileSystem;

/* ... */

var builder = new JobbrBuilder();

builder.AddFileSystemArtefactStorage(config =>
{
    // the only required property, can be relative, or an UNC-Path
    config.DataDirectory = @"D:\\ApplicationX\Data\JobRunStore";
});

server.Start();
```

> **Notice**: UNC-Paths are generally possible if they are reliable but have not been tested yet. If you're seeking for a high available implementation, the [RavenFS extension](https://github.com/jobbrIO/jobbr-artefactstorage-ravenfs) might be the better candidate for you.
